# Pairs-Trading-Pfizer-and-Merck
The inspiration for this is from the Motley Fool (https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/18/better-buy-pfizer-vs-merck.aspx). I wanted to try to analyze the Merck and Pfizer stocks in pairs trading. 
I then used an SVR and LSTM model to predict the differences in the two stocks to evaluate when to pivot position between shorting and longing each one.
